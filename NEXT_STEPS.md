# Next Steps for OverVibeViewer Development

This document outlines the next steps needed to complete the OverVibeViewer (OVV) application.

## Files to Obtain

1. **Minecraft Client JAR Files**
   - Add Minecraft client JAR file for version 1.21.4 to `docker/minecraft/client-1.21.4.jar`
   - Additional versions can be added following the same naming convention

## Development Tasks

1. **Complete the Web Application**
   - Implement actual file system access (likely requiring a native file system solution for production use)
   - Test the Socket.IO communication for streaming Overviewer output
   - Add proper error handling for all operations

2. **Test Docker Integration**
   - Test building the Docker container
   - Verify that the Overviewer builds correctly within the container
   - Test file system access between the container and the host system

3. **Script Improvements**
   - Add error handling to the start scripts
   - Add a cleanup script to remove Docker containers and images
   - Consider adding a script to download required Minecraft clients automatically

4. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Add progress indication for long-running processes
   - Improve the file selection interface
   - Add visualization for the output location

## Testing Plan

1. **Docker Testing**
   - Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Verify resource allocation and performance
   - Test with different Docker configuration options

2. **Map Generation Testing**
   - Test with different world sizes
   - Test with worlds from different Minecraft versions
   - Verify incremental updates work correctly

3. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Test on mobile devices (if applicable)
   - Test responsive design at different viewport sizes

## Optional Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Features**
   - Support for custom Overviewer configuration
   - Multiple rendering profiles (different view modes)
   - Support for texture packs
   - Language selection (beyond Russian)

2. **Performance Improvements**
   - Optimize Docker container size
   - Improve incremental rendering performance
   - Add caching mechanisms

3. **Distribution Improvements**
   - Consider creating installers for each platform
   - Add auto-update functionality
   - Publish to package repositories
